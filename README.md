# NDP Fitness Tracker

## The Problem
I want to track my fitness journey with an app that also diplays data to chart that journey. I dont want to be limited by internet connectivity, and want to be able to use a database to store that information.

## The Solution
I used Mongo and Mongoose to store all of the data in a readable database that was easy to use and impliment. I also wrote in JS and compressed the files to increase optimal run time
